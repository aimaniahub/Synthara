Verticillium Wilt,Fungal,"Wilting, yellowing, and death of leaves. Similar to Fusarium wilt. Can cause stunted growth.","Crop rotation, soil solarization, resistant varieties. No chemical control available."
Bacterial Wilt,Bacterial,"Rapid wilting of the plant while leaves stay green. Browning of stem tissue, yellowish ooze when cut.","Rotation with non-susceptible plants (corn, beans, cabbage), remove infected material, disease-free plants. Grafted plants available."
Bacterial Spot,Bacterial,"Small, angular, water-soaked spots on leaves with yellow halo. Raised, scabby spots on fruits.","Disease-free seeds and plants, avoid overhead watering, remove diseased material. Copper fungicide."
Bacterial Speck,Bacterial,"Small, dark spots on leaves and fruit. Yellow tissue around spots. Spots can be raised or sunken.","Copper fungicide during cool, wet weather. Delay planting until warmer, drier conditions."
Anthracnose,Fungal,"Small, circular, indented areas on ripening fruit, developing into darkened centers. Salmon-colored spores may be present.","Disease-free seed, avoid overhead irrigation, plant in sunny site, stake plants. Fungicides containing mancozeb or chlorothalonil."
Leaf Mold,Fungal,"Pale green/yellowish spots on upper leaf surface, with gray, velvety growth on lower surface. Black, leathery stem end on fruit.","Remove crop residue, staking and pruning for air circulation, avoid wetting leaves. Preventative fungicide program with chlorothalonil or mancozeb."
Tomato Pith Necrosis,Bacterial,"Blackened areas on stems, splitting stems, hollow pith. Yellowing of upper leaves, wilting.","Water base of plants, remove diseased plants. Follow fertilization recommendations, 3-year crop rotation."
Southern Blight,Fungal,"Drooping leaves, brown lesions near soil line, white fungal growth with brown sclerotia. Sudden wilt.","Crop rotation with grass crops, removal of plant debris, calcium nitrate, soil fumigation."
Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV),Viral,"Stunted plants, bronze spots on leaves, purple veins, yellow spots on fruit.","Eliminating weeds, reflective mulch, remove infected plants. TSWV-resistant cultivars."
Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV),Viral,"Upward curling leaves, yellow leaf margins, smaller leaves, plant stunting, flower drop.","Remove infected plants, control weeds, reflective mulches, horticultural oil sprays. TYLCV-resistant cultivars."
Mosaic Virus,Viral,"Mottling of leaves, malformation of leaflets, shoestring-like shape. Can be transmitted easily.","Remove infected plants, wash hands, eliminate weeds, control insects. Virus-resistant cultivars."
Root-Knot Nematodes,Nematode,"Stunted plants, discolored leaves, knots and galls on roots.","Crop rotation, disease-free plants, pull up roots after harvest, resistant cultivars, marigolds."
Gray Leaf Spot,Fungal,"Small, dark spots with yellow halos on leaves. Spots enlarge and turn grayish-brown. Centers of spots may crack and fall out.",Remove affected plants and debris. Select resistant varieties. Rotate crops.
Damping-off,Fungal,Seedlings fail to emerge or wilt and die soon after emergence. Water-soaked areas on stem near soil line.,"Start seeds indoors with sterilized potting mix, avoid over-watering, allow soil to dry between waterings."
Blossom End Rot,Physiological Disorder (Calcium Deficiency),"Dark, leathery, sunken areas on the blossom end of the tomato, most prevalent on enlarging fruit.",Keep plants well-watered and mulched. Check soil pH and amend accordingly. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizers.
Buckeye Rot,Fungal,"Brownish spots on fruit, often where the fruit contacts the soil. Dark, concentric rings may be seen in the spots.","Avoid compacted and poorly drained soils. Rotation, sanitation, staking, and mulching. Fungicide sprays with chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper fungicides."
Gray Wall,Physiological Disorder,"Green fruits have a gray cast and flattened, gray blotches. Ripe fruit has a mottled appearance with green and brown areas inside.","Ensure good growing conditions, evenly water and regularly fertilize plants. Keep soil from becoming compacted."
Sunscald,Environmental,"Pale-colored, sunken, blistered areas on tomato fruits exposed to full sun.",Cover exposed fruits. Control leaf diseases so foliage shades fruit.
Spider Mites,Arachnid (Pest),Tiny yellow-white spots (stippling). Spots coalesce causing yellow blotching. Dirty looking undersides of leaves.,Insecticide sprays (including soaps and oils) may be used. Make sure plants are not stressed.
Aphids,Insect (Pest),"Leaf curling, distortion, yellowing. Sticky honeydew.",Naturally occurring predators such as ladybird beetles control them.
Herbicide Damage,Chemical,"Leaves curled, twisted, strappy, distorted, stay small size.",Avoid herbicide drift. Use caution when spraying.
Flea Beetles,Insect (Pest),Tiny round holes (shot holes) in leaves.,Row cover fabric insect mesh over plants from time planting until flowering.
Tobacco/Tomato Hornworm,Insect (Pest),Leaves chewed and stripped off branches.,Remove caterpillars by hand and discard.
Stink Bug Feeding Damage,Insect (Pest),"Superficial spots and blotches, white on young fruit, yellow on mature fruit.",Cloudy spots on fruit can be cut out.
Catfacing,Environmental,"Tomatoes misshapen, often with deep crevices, holes and scarring on the blossom end.",Avoid cool temperatures during fruit set.
Growth Cracks,Environmental,Cracks radiating outward and concentric rings around the top of the fruit.,Maintain even soil moisture with regular watering and adequate mulch.
Edema,Environmental,"Tiny, dark brown circular spots that develop yellow rings (halos) on leaves",Reduce excessive moisture.
Cold Injury,Environmental,Light tan gray blotches on leaves.,Affected leaves out-grow injury if plants healthy not stressed further low temperatures.
Low Phosphorus,Nutrient Deficiency,Leaf undersides stems appear purple color.,Plants recover when roots fully established garden.
Zippering,Environmental,"Dry, brown scars resembling zippers extend from stem blossom end fruits.",Superficial condition that does not affect yields eating quality.
